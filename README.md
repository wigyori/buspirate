# Bus Pirate firmware

This repository aims to provide up-to-date pre-built, non-optimized binaries for your Bus Pirate v3/v4.

As the manufacturer seems to have dropped the ball on the development of the firmware for these devices, the
community has picked it up and continued. However, the last pre-built binary was built in 09/2016, and the build
procedure is a bit tedious, which also includes downloading a full MPLABX IDE.

### What is a Bus Pirate?

The Bus Pirate is an open source hacker multi-tool that talks to electronic stuff. It's got a bunch of features an intrepid hacker might need to prototype their next project.
